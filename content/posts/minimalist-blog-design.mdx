A minimalist blog design focuses on simplicity and content-first approach. In this post, we'll explore the key principles and implementation details of creating a clean, minimalist blog design.

## Key Principles

### 1. Typography

Choose a clean, readable font and maintain consistent sizing throughout your blog. We're using a simple system:

- Headings: Clear hierarchy with appropriate spacing
- Body text: Optimal line length and height for readability
- Monospace: For code blocks and technical content

### 2. White Space

Effective use of white space helps content breathe and improves readability:

- Generous margins and padding
- Clear separation between sections
- Balanced layout composition

### 3. Color Palette

A minimal color scheme enhances focus:

- Primary text: Dark gray for readability
- Secondary text: Lighter gray for less emphasis
- Accent color: Used sparingly for important elements

## Implementation

We've implemented these principles using:

```typescript
// Example of our typography scale
const typography = {
  h1: 'text-4xl font-bold',
  h2: 'text-2xl font-semibold',
  body: 'text-base leading-relaxed',
};
```

The result is a clean, distraction-free reading experience that puts your content first.
